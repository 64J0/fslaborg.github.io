### **what is fslab?** 

<!---C1-->

### **for developers**:

fslab is a **F#-first** community project incubation space for **all things data science**. We aim to be a safe haven for both projects aiming to gain traction in the data science space and projects to rejuvenate or get new maintainers.

<!---C2-->

### **for users**:

fslab aims to be **the resource** for data science in F#. Wether you never wrote a line of code before, or you already are a skilled data scientist trying out things in .NET, we strive to have you covered with up-to-date, curated **tutorials, documentation, and package recommendations**.
