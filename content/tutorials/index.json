As you can see from analyzing the printed output, it consists of 506 rows. Each row represents a house in the boston city area and each column encodes a feature/variable, such as the number of rooms per dwelling (RoomsPerDwelling), Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000\u0027s (MedianHomeValue) and even variables indicating if the house is bordering river charles (CharlesRiver, value = 1) or not (CharlesRiver, value = 0). \n\nLets say in our analysis we are only interested in the variables just described, furthermore we only want to keep rows where the value of the indicator variable is 0. We can use Deedle to easily create a new frame that fullfills our criteria.

The following snippet illustrates how we can access a column of a data frame and create an interactive chart in no time. Since we might want an idea of the distribution of the house prices a histogram can come in handy: \n*)\nopen Plotly.NET\n\n// Note that we explicitly specify that we want to work with the values as floats. \n// Since the row identity is not needed anymore when plotting the distribution we can\n// directly convert the collection to a FSharp Sequence. \nlet pricesNotAtRiver : seq\u003Cfloat\u003E = \n    housesNotAtRiver\n    |\u003E Frame.getCol \u0022MedianHomeValue\u0022\n    |\u003E Series.values\n    \nlet h1 = \n    Chart.Histogram(pricesNotAtRiver)\n    |\u003E Chart.withX_AxisStyle(\u0022median value of owner occupied homes in 1000s\u0022)\n    |\u003E Chart.withX_AxisStyle(\u0022price distribution\u0022)\n\n(*** condition: ipynb ***)\n#if IPYNB\nh1\n#endif // IPYNB\n\n(***hide***)\nh1 |\u003E GenericChart.toChartHTML\n(***include-it-raw***)\n\n(**\nSince plotly charts are interactive they invite us to combine mutliple charts.

We can now reconstruct our own idea of the city of boston, the sampled area, just by looking at the data e.g.:\n\nAssuming that the sampling process was homogenous while observing that there are much more houses sampled that are not located on the riverside could indicate that a spot on the river is a scarce commodity.\nThis could also be backed by analyzing the tails of the distribution: it seems that houses located at the river are given a head-start in their assigned value - the distribution of the riverside houses is truncated on the left. \n\nSuppose we would have a customer that wants two models, one to predict the prices of a house at the riverside and one that predicts the prices if this is not the case, then we can meet this demand by using FSharp.Stats in combination with Deedle. Of course we need a variable that is indicative of the house price, in this we will check if the number of rooms per dwelling correlates with the house value:\n*)\n\nlet pricesAll :Series\u003Cint,float\u003E = \n    dataAsFrame\n    |\u003E Frame.getCol \u0022MedianHomeValue\u0022\n\nlet roomsPerDwellingAll :Series\u003Cint,float\u003E = \n    dataAsFrame\n    |\u003E Frame.getCol \u0022RoomsPerDwelling\u0022   \n\nlet correlation = \n    let tmpPrices,tmpRooms = \n        Series.zipInner pricesAll roomsPerDwellingAll    \n        |\u003E Series.values \n        |\u003E Seq.unzip\n    Correlation.Seq.pearson tmpPrices tmpRooms\n                                              \n(***include-value:correlation***)\n\n(**\nSo indeed, the number of rooms per dwelling shows a positiv correlation with the house prices. With a pearson correlation of ~0.7 it does not explain the house prices completely - but this is nothing that really surprises us, as one of our hypothesis is that the location (e.g. riverside) does also have influence on the price -  however, it should be sufficient to create a linear model. \n\nSo now we will use FSharp.Stats to build the two linear models ordered by the hypothetical customer. We start by defining a function that performs the fitting and plots the result:\n*)\n\nopen Fitting.LinearRegression.OrdinaryLeastSquares\n\nlet predictPricesByRooms description data = \n    let pricesAll :Series\u003C_,float\u003E = \n        data\n        |\u003E Frame.getCol \u0022MedianHomeValue\u0022\n\n    let roomsPerDwellingAll :Series\u003C_,float\u003E = \n        data\n        |\u003E Frame.getCol \u0022RoomsPerDwelling\u0022   \n\n    let fit = \n        let tmpRooms, tmpPrices = \n            Series.zipInner roomsPerDwellingAll pricesAll    \n            |\u003E Series.sortBy fst\n            |\u003E Series.values \n            |\u003E Seq.unzip\n        let coeffs = Linear.Univariable.coefficient (vector tmpRooms) (vector tmpPrices)\n        let model  = Linear.Univariable.fit coeffs \n        let predictedPrices = tmpRooms |\u003E Seq.map model\n        [\n        Chart.Point(tmpRooms,tmpPrices)\n        |\u003E Chart.withTraceName (sprintf \u0022%s: data\u0022 description )\n        Chart.Line(tmpRooms,predictedPrices)\n        |\u003E Chart.withTraceName (sprintf \u0022%s: coefficients: intercept:%f, slope:%f\u0022 description coeffs.[0] coeffs.[1])\n        ]                                  \n        |\u003E Chart.Combine\n        |\u003E Chart.withX_AxisStyle(\u0022rooms per dwelling\u0022)\n        |\u003E Chart.withY_AxisStyle(\u0022median value\u0022)\n    fit   \n\n(**\nAfterwards, we can apply the function on our prepared datasets and have a look at the model and especially the model coefficients. \n*)\nlet modelVis = \n    [\n    predictPricesByRooms \u0022not at river\u0022 housesNotAtRiver\n    predictPricesByRooms \u0022at river\u0022 housesAtRiver\n    ]\n    |\u003E Chart.Combine\n    |\u003E Chart.withSize(1200.,700.)\n\n(***hide***)\nmodelVis |\u003E GenericChart.toChartHTML\n(***include-it-raw***)\n\n\n(**\nBoth models approximate the data in a reasonable way.

In this example we also cast the value of the column \u0022CharlesRiver\u0022 to be of type bool, this illustrates how data frame programming can become typesafe using deedle.\n*)\n\nlet housesNotAtRiver = \n    dataAsFrame\n    |\u003E Frame.sliceCols [\u0022RoomsPerDwelling\u0022;\u0022MedianHomeValue\u0022;\u0022CharlesRiver\u0022]\n    |\u003E Frame.filterRowValues (fun s -\u003E s.GetAs\u003Cbool\u003E(\u0022CharlesRiver\u0022) |\u003E not ) \n\n//sprintf \u0022The new frame does now contain: %i rows and %i columns\u0022 housesNotAtRiver.RowCount housesNotAtRiver.ColumnCount\n\nhousesNotAtRiver.Print()\n\n(*** include-output ***)\n\n// (**\n// ## Data exploration\n\n// Exploratory data analysis is an approach favored by many - to meet this demand we strongly advertise the use of Plotly.Net. The following snippet illustrates how we can access a column of a data frame and create an interactive chart in no time. Since we might want an idea of the distribution of the house prices a histogram can come in handy: \n// *)\n\n// // Note that we explicitly specify that we want to work with the values as floats. \n// // Since the row identity is not needed anymore when plotting the distribution we can\n// // directly convert the collection to a FSharp Sequence. \n// let pricesNotAtRiver : seq\u003Cfloat\u003E = \n//     housesNotAtRiver\n//     |\u003E Frame.getCol \u0022MedianHomeValue\u0022\n//     |\u003E Series.values\n    \n// let h1 = \n//     Chart.Histogram(pricesNotAtRiver)\n//     |\u003E Chart.withX_AxisStyle(\u0022median value of owner occupied homes in 1000s\u0022)\n//     |\u003E Chart.withX_AxisStyle(\u0022price distribution\u0022)\n\n// (*** condition: ipynb ***)\n// #if IPYNB\n// h1\n// #endif // IPYNB\n\n// (***hide***)\n// h1 |\u003E GenericChart.toChartHTML\n// (***include-it-raw***)\n\n// (**\n// Since plotly charts are interactive they invite us to combine mutliple charts.

We can now reconstruct our own idea of the city of boston, the sampled area, just by looking at the data e.g.:\n\n// Assuming that the sampling process was homogenous while observing that there are much more houses sampled that are not located on the riverside could indicate that a spot on the river is a scarce commodity.\n// This could also be backed by analyzing the tails of the distribution: it seems that houses located at the river are given a head-start in their assigned value - the distribution of the riverside houses is truncated on the left. \n\n// Suppose we would have a customer that wants two models, one to predict the prices of a house at the riverside and one that predicts the prices if this is not the case, then we can meet this demand by using FSharp.Stats in combination with Deedle. Of course we need a variable that is indicative of the house price, in this we will check if the number of rooms per dwelling correlates with the house value:\n// *)\n\n// let pricesAll :Series\u003Cint,float\u003E = \n//     dataAsFrame\n//     |\u003E Frame.getCol \u0022MedianHomeValue\u0022\n\n// let roomsPerDwellingAll :Series\u003Cint,float\u003E = \n//     dataAsFrame\n//     |\u003E Frame.getCol \u0022RoomsPerDwelling\u0022   \n\n// let correlation = \n//     let tmpPrices,tmpRooms = \n//         Series.zipInner pricesAll roomsPerDwellingAll    \n//         |\u003E Series.values \n//         |\u003E Seq.unzip\n//     Correlation.Seq.pearson tmpPrices tmpRooms\n                                              \n// (***include-value:correlation***)\n\n// (**\n// So indeed, the number of rooms per dwelling shows a positiv correlation with the house prices. With a pearson correlation of ~0.7 it does not explain the house prices completely - but this is nothing that really surprises us, as one of our hypothesis is that the location (e.g. riverside) does also have influence on the price -  however, it should be sufficient to create a linear model. \n\n// So now we will use FSharp.Stats to build the two linear models ordered by the hypothetical customer. We start by defining a function that performs the fitting and plots the result:\n// *)\n\n// open Fitting.LinearRegression.OrdinaryLeastSquares\n\n// let predictPricesByRooms description data = \n//     let pricesAll :Series\u003C_,float\u003E = \n//         data\n//         |\u003E Frame.getCol \u0022MedianHomeValue\u0022\n\n//     let roomsPerDwellingAll :Series\u003C_,float\u003E = \n//         data\n//         |\u003E Frame.getCol \u0022RoomsPerDwelling\u0022   \n\n//     let fit = \n//         let tmpRooms, tmpPrices = \n//             Series.zipInner roomsPerDwellingAll pricesAll    \n//             |\u003E Series.sortBy fst\n//             |\u003E Series.values \n//             |\u003E Seq.unzip\n//         let coeffs = Linear.Univariable.coefficient (vector tmpRooms) (vector tmpPrices)\n//         let model  = Linear.Univariable.fit coeffs \n//         let predictedPrices = tmpRooms |\u003E Seq.map model\n//         [\n//         Chart.Point(tmpRooms,tmpPrices)\n//         |\u003E Chart.withTraceName (sprintf \u0022%s: data\u0022 description )\n//         Chart.Line(tmpRooms,predictedPrices)\n//         |\u003E Chart.withTraceName (sprintf \u0022%s: coefficients: intercept:%f, slope:%f\u0022 description coeffs.[0] coeffs.[1])\n//         ]                                  \n//         |\u003E Chart.Combine\n//         |\u003E Chart.withX_AxisStyle(\u0022rooms per dwelling\u0022)\n//         |\u003E Chart.withY_AxisStyle(\u0022median value\u0022)\n//     fit   \n\n// (**\n// Afterwards, we can apply the function on our prepared datasets and have a look at the model and especially the model coefficients. \n// *)\n// let modelVis = \n//     [\n//     predictPricesByRooms \u0022not at river\u0022 housesNotAtRiver\n//     predictPricesByRooms \u0022at river\u0022 housesAtRiver\n//     ]\n//     |\u003E Chart.Combine\n//     |\u003E Chart.withSize(1200.,700.)\n\n// (***hide***)\n// modelVis |\u003E GenericChart.toChartHTML\n// (***include-it-raw***)\n\n\n// (**\n// Both models approximate the data in a reasonable way.
