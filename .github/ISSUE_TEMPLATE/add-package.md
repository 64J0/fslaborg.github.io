Thanks for taking the time to file a package for addition to our endorsed packages list! Please tell us more about your package!

## What is the purpose/aim of your package? What problem does it solve?

## What does your package bring to the table that others on the list don't / to which packages can it be considered an alternative?

## Requirements

- [ ] (Mandatory) My project uses a permissive/[OSI approved](https://opensource.org/licenses) license


The main goal of fslab is to streamline the datascience environment of F#. 

In a first step we want to collect and foster open source datascience packages and create a save haven for F# open source maintainers and developers

We want to encourage interaction between these libraries to move forward together, 
as well as prevent fslab from becoming just an address to dump a project url for easy promotion. Therefore, while we don't want to set up strict requirements - especially in this critical first phase of fslab - 
we kindly ask you to meet at least **one of the following requirements** are with your package:

- [ ] Additionally to the package documentation itself, **tutorials and guides** on how to get started with and interact with other fslab packages will be included at the time of joining the list. See the [next chapter](#add-a-tutorial-guide-or-blogpost) on how to do that.

- [ ] The github repository that holds the source code of the package will **move to the fslab github organization** (with no changes to repo access besides access for fslab admins). This increases the weight of fslab as a center of gravity for open source F# developers and would be the best choice for projects that are in need for new maintainers.

- [ ] The **documentation** of the project will be changed or created in the [**fslab documentation theme**](). This ensures fostering a certain fslab 'brand awareness'
