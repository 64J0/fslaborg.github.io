Flips is an F# library for modeling and solving Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problems. It is inspired by the work of the PuLP library for Python and the excellent Gurobi Python library. It builds on the work of the outstanding [Google OR-Tools library](https://github.com/google/or-tools) and the [OPTANO](https://optano.com/en/modeling/) library .
